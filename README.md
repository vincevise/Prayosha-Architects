# Prayosha Architects

Developed a React website for an architecture firm that was deployed on Cloudflare Pages, along with a web application for content management. The web application allowed the firm to add and update projects, and was backed by AWS Lambda and AWS DynamoDB for efficient database management and AWS-S3 bucket for image storage. Overall, this project provided valuable experience in web development, AWS services, and project management, as I collaborated closely with the client to deliver a customized solution that met their needs.
